        <td>0 The Fool</td>
        <td><p>Portrayed as a jester laughing very close to a cliff, accompanied with a dog at his heels. <br>
      The Fool represents innocence, divine inspiration, madness, freedom, spontaneity, inexperience, chaos and creativity. <br>
      This Arcana is originally the only one that doesn't have a number, thus it is considered as the Arcana number 0 or number 22. <br>
      The Fool Arcana tends to be the "jack of all trades," since its Personas can inherit all skills without preference for any type. <br>
      Mythological figures of the Fool Arcana are often heroes, fools or the protagonists of their own mythological stories. <br>
      The common theme between the protagonists of the Fool Arcana is the concept of new beginnings and stepping into the unknown, represented by their transferring into a new city for a year, provoking curiosity and exploration.</p></td>

        <td><p>In tarot readings, the Magician Arcana is commonly associated with action, initiative, self-confidence, immaturity, manipulation, and power (more specifically, the power to harness one's talents).<br>
      Personas of the Magician Arcana are commonly Personas that excel at Magic, particularly with Fire-based spells. <br>
      As the name suggests, mythological figures associated with the Magician Arcana are often associated with magic themselves, though there are some fire deities mixed in as well.</p></td>

        <td><p>Originally named the Popess, portrayed as an old woman with an open book, the Priestess Arcana is a symbol of hidden knowledge or other untapped power, wisdom, female mystery and patience when it appears in tarot readings.<br>
      Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Priestess Arcana are commonly associated with healing and support attributes. <br>
      Mythological figures of the Priestess Arcana are usually crone archetypes, goddesses of wisdom, witches, female mages or priestess figures themselves.</p></td>

          <td><p>In tarot readings, the Empress represents mothers, prosperity, creativity, sexuality, abundance, fertility, protection, and comfort (most often in helping maintain peace around them like an ideal mother would). <br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Empress Arcana are often Personas excelling in Ice-based attacks with healing powers also relatively common; <br>
        they are usually important female figures, and many are queens and mother goddesses of some sort.</p></td>

          <td>IV The Emperor</td>
          <td><p>In tarot readings, the Emperor symbolizes the desire to control one's surroundings, and its appearance could suggest that one is trying too hard to achieve this, possibly causing trouble for others; some elements in life are just not controllable.<br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Emperor Arcana are Personas typically excelling in Electricity-based and Physical attacks (or to an extent, Ice-based attacks); <br>
        these Personas are almost always kings or emperor figures, but may simply be important male figures and deities.<br> 
        Typically, the king of a mythological pantheon is of the Emperor Arcana.</p></td>

          <td>V The Hierophant</td>
          <td><p>The Hierophant is a symbol of education, authority, conservatism, obedience to rules and relationship with the divine. <br>
        The definition of a "hierophant" is a person who interprets sacred mysteries or esoteric principles, and the term was originally used to name ancient Greek priests who did so. <br>
        This Arcana's original name, however, is the Pope, the male counterpart of the Popess (Priestess in the series).<br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Hierophant Arcana have no weaknesses, but no particular strengths as well. <br>
        Hierophant mythological figures tend to mirror Priestess figures, being male priests, gods of wisdom or divine beings.</p></td>

          <td><img src="Image/P5_Lover_arcana_cooperation.webp" alt="Lover" width="400" height="500"></td>
          <td>VI The Lovers</td>
          <td><p>In tarot readings, the Lovers Arcana initially represented two paths life could lead to, and thus a symbol of standing at a crossroad and needing to make a decision.<br>
        Today, however, it is portrayed more of a symbol of love and romantic relationships, although it can also be a symbol of finding agreement with an ordinary friend or even two conflicting elements within.<br>
        This can explain that the designs of the card for most Persona entries are centered around a male and female character, though the original card shows a man who must choose between one mature and serious woman and a young and beautiful woman, with Cupid above his head preparing to shoot a single arrow.<br>
        This drawing is more representative of the idea of hesitation and decision between the "right" way and the "easy" way.</p></td>

          <td><p>Portrayed as a king leading a chariot made up of two differently colored horses (in some cases mythical creatures).<br>
        The Chariot Arcana is a symbol of victory, conquest, self-assertion, self-confidence, control, war, and command.<br>
        Personas of the Chariot Arcana are commonly Personas excelling in Physical-based attacks. <br>
        They are almost invariably warrior figures or mythological war deities.</p></td>

        In tarot readings, it means that one will have to face a trial of their justice.<br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Justice Arcana are commonly Personas excelling in Light-based affinities. <br>
        Justice Personas are usually various orders of angels, and are otherwise deities of justice, order or vengeance. </p></td>

          <td><p>Portrayed as an old man in a dark place or cave, holding up a lantern, the Hermit is associated with wisdom, introspection, solitude, retreat and philosophical searches.<br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Hermit Arcana are commonly Personas excelling in Mental-Ailment skills. <br>
        Mythological figures associated with the Hermit Arcana are usually hermits themselves, or are otherwise figures or deities that exist and operate behind the scenes.</p></td>

          <td><p>Portrayed as a young woman holding up a terrifying beast (more often a lion), the Strength Arcana symbolizes an imagery beyond the Beast And Beauty, and is associated with the morality about the stronger power of self-control, gentleness, courage and virtue over brute force.<br>
        In tarot readings, it can also represent creative or physical energy that needs to be or is about to be unleashed, sometimes out of desire to be recognized. <br>
        The card is also named Fortitude in some decks, further giving meanings revolving on courage.</p></td>

        the Hanged Man Arcana is associated with self-sacrifice for the sake of enlightenment, the bindings that makes one free, paradoxes and hanging between heaven and earth.<br>
        In Tarot readings, this card's appearance can be seen as an advice to take the time necessary to reflect over one's upcoming actions.</p></td>

          <td>XIII The Death</td>
          <td><p>The Death Arcana is debatably one of the most misunderstood cards in the standard Tarot deck because of its common interpretations that imply a physical death.<br>
        While it is certainly associated with foreboding and doom, the Death Arcana also symbolizes metamorphosis and deep change, regeneration and cycles.<br>
        In the earliest Tarot decks, it was the only Arcana that didn't have a name, but the depictions of an ominous skeleton bearing a scythe led people to call it Death.</p></td>

          <td><p>Portrayed as a woman with angel wings mixing up the water of two cups, one blue, the other red, the Temperance Arcana is a symbol of synthesis, prudence, harmony, and the merging of opposites.<br>
        Gameplay-wise, the Personas of the Temperance Arcana are often well-rounded Personas. <br>
        Personas of the Temperance Arcana are mythological figures associated with balance and moderation. <br>
        The Temperance Arcana is primarily home to mythological beasts rather than human figures.</p></td>

          <td><p>Portrayed as a devil over two naked and chained figures, the negative aspect of the Devil Arcana represents the urge to do selfish, impulsive, violent things, and being a slave to one's own impulse and feelings.<br>
        Occasionally, it is also portrayed as a symbol of temptation. <br>
        The positive aspect, however, represents a healthy bond or commitment.</p></td>

        a straight Tower of Babel allegory about pride preceding the fall. <br>
        The Tower Arcana is commonly associated to overly arrogant, prejudiced and authoritarian organizations, which walk to their own ironic demise.<br>
        Furthermore, it is also more generically used as an omen of doom and disaster. <br>

        The Moon Arcana is associated with creativity, inspiration, dreams, madness, illusions, fear, fantasy, the subconscious and trickery. <br>

        On the other hand, reversed, it can represent blind faith misplaced in something that does not deserve trust.<br>
